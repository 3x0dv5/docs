"The Open Source Geospatial Foundation, or OSGeo for short, will seek to "

" serve as an outreach and advocacy organization for the community; a forum "

"large government and corporate users; a source of shared infrastructure, "
"like code and documentation repositories; and as a legal entity to help "
"protect developers and users of Open Source geospatial software against "
"greedy patent lawsuits or unscrupulous license infringements. In general, "
"the object of the Foundation will be, in the words of Mark Lucas of OSSIM, "
"to \"help us do what we love\" -- which, for most of us, is building useful "
"tools for digital cartography and geospatial analysis, and solving "

"By this time the core MapServer code has become widely used by many of the "

"At present MapServer uses different pixel and extent model than defined by "
"OGC services such as WCS and WMS. MapServer uses the center of a pixel to "
"represent its unique coordinate value. An extent is interpreted as the "
"bounding box that runs from the center of the UL pixel in an image to the "
"center of the LR pixel in an image. Why? Well, it goes back to companion "
"software that existed along side MapServer to display satellite data stored "
"in ERDAS that used the center to center extent model. The math is simple and"
" there is a certain logic in having the extent actually represent pixel "
"values - that is, if you render the extent as a polygon you get the exact "
