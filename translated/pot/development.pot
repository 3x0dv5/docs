In 6.2, there is no label allocated in the class object by default and your MapScript code (python, etc.) has to create new label objects and add them to the class object. Three new methods were added to the `classObj` in MapScript to handle this: ``getLabel``, ``addLabel``, ``removeLabel``.

The Foundation will hopefully serve as an outreach and advocacy organization for the community; a forum for improving cross-project collaboration; a unified professional front for large government and corporate users; a source of shared infrastructure, like code and documentation repositories; and as a legal entity to help protect developers and users of Open Source geospatial software against greedy patent lawsuits or unscrupulous license infringements. In general, the object of the Foundation will be, in the words of Mark Lucas of OSSIM, to \"help us do what we love\" -- which, for most of us, is building useful tools for digital cartography and geospatial analysis, and solving interesting problems with them."

msgid "By this time the core MapServer code has become widely used by many of the different application models. The extended usage of MapScript causes the possibility that the execution of the code is carried out by multiple threads, standing a fair chance portions of the code being called by the different threads simultaneously. The threading model of the application may fall beyond the control of the MapServer code, at the worst case even the host process of the application is beyond the programmer's scope. For example a web mapping application may be executed by a pre-existing host process ensuring to serve the user requests and calling the MapServer code by different threads from a pool of threads. The usage of process-wide global variables and resources within MapServer may require the need to serialize of the access to the variable by the multiple threads by using locks. The current approach uses process-wide locks to ensure the safe access to these variables causing performance degradation in multithreaded environments. Currently this behavior may be controlled by the USE_THREAD compilation switch."

msgid "Currently the various query operations involve multiple accesses to the data providers which may cause a significant performance impact depending on the providers. In the first phase all of the features in the given search area are retrieved and the index of the relevant shapes are stored in the result cache. In the second phase the features in the result cache are retrieved form the provider one by one. Retaining the shapes in the memory we could eliminate the need of the subsequent accesses to the providers and increase the overall performance of the query. Implementing the cache requires a transformation of the data between the data provider and the client. From this aspect it is desirable to provide a framework to implement this transformation in a higher level of abstraction."

An extent is interpreted as the bounding box that runs from the center of the UL pixel in an image to the center of the LR pixel in an image. Why? Well, it goes back to companion software that existed along side MapServer to display satellite data stored in ERDAS that used the center to center extent model. The math is simple and there is a certain logic in having the extent actually represent pixel values - that is, if you render the extent as a polygon you get the exact edge of the image as one might expect."

That does add complexity to the map <=> image coordinate transformations since you have to offset things by one-half cellsize. Since that computation is done many times I would expect a performance hit. We could optimize things by computing and storing the one-half cellsize value once (as cellsize is now), but that complicates the C APIs and requires huge amounts of change. I propose moving to a upper-left-based pixel model to simplify these conversions."

msgid "That said, we are still heavily vested in GD for many things. Text positioning and raster rendering in particular use GD functions directly. On the other hand, AGG does not have built in functions to read or write popular graphics formats such as GIF, JPEG or PNG. It makes sense then to consider a hybrid solution wherein we can take advantage of aspects of GD that make sense such as buffer management and I/O capabilities, and let AGG worry about rendering features. That's exactly what is proposed- AGG rendering into a GD managed image buffer. A secondary benefit is that AGG functionality can be added incrementally as time and resources permit. For example, since an AGG imageObj is really just a gdImagePtr we can use current code that renders to a GD image along side any AGG routines."

Other drivers could choose to combine the extent and expression string (more likely the tokens) if they so choose. msQueryByFilter() works much like msQueryByAttributes(). The layer API has been extended to include a prototype, msLayerSupportsCommonFilters(), that allows the driver to say if it could process this common expression format natively somehow (e.g. via a FILTER and msLayerWhichShapes()/ msLayerNextShape()) or if the expression would need to be applied after msLayerNextShape() is called repeatedly. The shapefile and tiled shapefile drivers would work natively, as would any driver that uses msEvalExpression().

This was a reasonable thing to do and the PostGIS driver was changed at the sprint to behave the same way. So, the shapeindex contains the overall record index and the tileindex contains the index relative to the query result set. This re-use of the tileindex takes advantage of a an attribute that otherwise would go unused and saves us from further complicating things.

It can help to check on pieces of the core MapServer code, but is no guarantor of the :ref:`mapserv` program or of the :ref:`PHP MapScript <php_mapscript>` module. As of this writing, there are 159 tests in the suite.  These are tests of features added since mid-2003. Much of MapServer's older stuff remains untested and it is doubtful that we'll make the time to go back and fill in."
