"MapServer is an `Open Source`_ geographic data rendering engine written in "
"C. Beyond browsing GIS data, MapServer allows you create \"geographic image "
"maps\", that is, maps that can direct users to content. For example, the "
"Minnesota DNR `Recreation Compass "
"<http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/maps/compass.html>`__ provides users with more "
"than 10,000 web pages, reports and maps via a single application. The same "
"application serves as a \"map engine\" for other portions of the site, "
"providing spatial context where needed."
