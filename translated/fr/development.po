"The Open Source Geospatial Foundation, or OSGeo for short, will seek to "
"provide roughly the same kind of function for the F/OSS GIS community that "
"the Apache Software Foundation provides for the Apache development and user "
"communities, with the primary difference being that, where Apache started as"
" a single project and then branched out, the OSGeo Foundation is attempting "
"to weld together the overlapping but sometimes disparate interests of "
"different projects with different communities. The Foundation will hopefully"
" serve as an outreach and advocacy organization for the community; a forum "
"for improving cross-project collaboration; a unified professional front for "
"large government and corporate users; a source of shared infrastructure, "
"like code and documentation repositories; and as a legal entity to help "
"protect developers and users of Open Source geospatial software against "
"greedy patent lawsuits or unscrupulous license infringements. In general, "
"the object of the Foundation will be, in the words of Mark Lucas of OSSIM, "
"to \"help us do what we love\" -- which, for most of us, is building useful "
"tools for digital cartography and geospatial analysis, and solving "
"interesting problems with them."

"By this time the core MapServer code has become widely used by many of the "

"At present MapServer uses different pixel and extent model than defined by "

"center of the LR pixel in an image. Why? Well, it goes back to companion "
"software that existed along side MapServer to display satellite data stored "
