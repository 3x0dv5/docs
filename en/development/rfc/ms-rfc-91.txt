MS RFC 91: Layer Filter Normalization
=========================================================================

:Status: Draft
:Version: MapServer 6.4

1. Overview
-----------

Layer filters are driver specific expressions that are used within MapServer in a couple of ways:

  1) to define feature subsets for rendering (indpendent of classes)
  2) to define feature subsets for selected query operations

The first use case generally applies to drivers that don't support some sort expression language (e.g. SQL). While supported
for PostGIS and Oracle Spatial there is little reason to use filters since the necessary SQL is better expressed in the
layer data statement. For non-RDMS drivers filters are defined either by a item/value combination or a using MapServer's 
standard expression syntax.

The second use case applies to all drivers where filters are defined using driver specific syntax to extract features from a
data source. This leads to a number of issues:

  - confusion and inconsistencies in mapfile syntax
  - lack of portabilty of filters between drivers
  - performance limitations because only the simplest filters are easy to represent and secure

Futhermore, the above two use cases are mutually e which again can lead to user confusion. Existing query operations that
rely on filters (by attribute, by operator) cache the existing filter before defining and applying a new one. While
this limitation could be addressed independently it becomes a much more manageable task when using a standardized filter
definition.


2. Proposed solution
--------------------

This SLA proposed standardizing filter definitions using the common expresion syntax implemented as part of RFC XX. Drivers
capable of handling complex expressions will translate MapServer expressions to an internal representation which should
lead to *very* significant performance improvements. Drivers that don't have that capability would apply filtering to features
much the same way as the native MapServer shapefile and tiled shapefiles already do (via msXXXLayerNextShape())

2.1 Driver Filter Translation
-----------------------------

Drivers that support complex expressions (e.g. PostGIS and Oracle Spatial) will need to implement a new layer API function
(propose msXXXLayerTranslateFilter()) to translate a MapServer common expression to a native representation. MapServer
exressions consist of a series of tokens that are from from left to right. It should be possible then to

3. Implementation Details
-------------------------

3.1 Overview
------------

- there are no new keywords with minor structure changes (expressionObj)
- there are no changes to the MapScript API
- drivers that support complex expressions (e.g. PostGIS, Oracle, SQL Server) 
  need to implement a translation funcion to construct a partial "WHERE" clause
  from a set of expression/filter tokens
- ... 

3.2 Files affected
------------------

The following files will be modified by this RFC:

- mapquery.c
- maplayer.c: changes/additions to layer API function
- mapshape.c, mappostgis.c, mapogr.c.... : changes/additions to driver functions

3.3 MapScript
-------------

No changes necessary.

3.4 Backwards Compatibilty Issues
---------------------------------

By respecting a pre-defined FILTER...


4. Security implications
------------------------

TODO

5. Performance implications
---------------------------

The token replacement is only done in msLayerOpen(), the performance impact
should be negligeable as this happens only once per rendered layer. Performance
will improve greatly in some cases where operations are offloaded to the 
database - less network traffic, more efficient algorithms.


6. Bug ID
---------

None assigned.
