MS RFC 100: Support for tile index with mixed SRS in raster layers
==================================================================

:Date:  2013/07
:Author: Even Rouault
:Contact: even dot rouault at mines-paris dot org
:Status: Draft
:Version: MapServer 6.4

1. Overview
-----------

Raster layers can directly connect to a GDAL dataset or through a tile index.
But until now, the rasters in the same tile index should have identical SRS.

For the sake of simplicity of the administration of MapServer mapfiles,
and/or to avoid unnecessary reprojections of rasters into a common SRS
(which might be different from the requested SRS of a WMS or WCS request),
it is desirable to have support for tile index with rasters of heterogenous SRS.

2. Proposed solution
--------------------

In the case where a tile index has tiles with mixed SRS, a new keyword, TILESRS
"field_name", must be added in a LAYER block to specify that the field
"field_name" contains the SRS of each tile.

.. code-block:: mapfile

    LAYER
        NAME "tile_index_mixed_srs_26711"
        TYPE RASTER
        STATUS ON
        DUMP TRUE
        TILEINDEX "tile_index_mixed_srs_26711.shp"
        TILEITEM "location"
        TILESRS "src_srs"
        PROJECTION
            "+init=epsg:26711" 
        END
    END

However, it is absolutely necesserary that the geometry (extent) of each tile
is expressed in a common SRS (the one declared in the PROJECTION block of the
LAYER block), so that spatial queries in the tileindex can work.

Such tileindex files that have tiles with mixed SRS can be generated with an
updated version of the GDAL gdaltindex utility, by using the -t_srs and
-src_srs_name options.

::

    gdaltindex -t_srs EPSG:4326 -src_srs_name src_srs mytileindex.shp *.tif

Those tile index can be used for example in WMS or WCS layers. For WCS layers,
a few metadata fields must be specified in the LAYER definition, so as to
define a "virtual dataset" coverage (see :ref:`wcs_server`).
A new GDAL python sample script, wcs_virtds_params.py, will be added to ease the
writing of such layers.

3. Implementation Details
-------------------------

3.1 Files affected
..................

The main changes are in mapraster.c. Note that a code refactoring has been done
to factor identical code found in msDrawRasterLayerLow() from mapraster.c and
msRasterQueryByRect() from maprasterquery.c.

* mapcopy.c : deal with layerObj.tilesrs
* mapfile.c : deal with layerObj.tilesrs and TILESRS
* mapfile.dtd : deal with TILESRS
* mapfile.h : add TILESRS constant
* maplayer.c : deal with layerObj.orig_tilesrs
* maplexer.c : regenerated from maplexer.l
* maplexer.l : deal with TILESRS
* mapogr.cpp : generates error if TILESRS is used in a vector layer (unsupported)
* mapraster.c : core of changes to deal with layerObj.tilesrs; code rafactoring
* mapraster.h : new file to declare common functions between mapraster.c and maprasterquery.c
* maprasterquery.c : refactored to share common code with mapraster.c
* mapserver.h :  add tilesrs and orig_tilesrs member in layerObj struct
* mapshape.c : generates error if TILESRS is used in a vector layer (unsupported).
  add capability to get projection info from .prj file when PROJECTION = AUTO


3.2 Backwards Compatibilty Issues
.................................

None expected, new functionality.

3.3 MapScript changes
.................................

None

3.4 Performance implications
.................................

Finding tiles that match the request window will be as fast as for tile index
with same SRS. On-the-fly reprojection will only occur for tiles that intersect
the request window. So the performance should be similar to current situations
where a tile index with tiles in SRS=srs1 is requested with SRS=srs2.

3.5 Related bug fixes
......................

The following syntax did not work properly in layers that refered to a TILEINDEX.

.. code-block:: mapfile

    PROJECTION
        AUTO
    END

It couldn't fetch the projection from the tile index layer, even when it was
available.

Another related fix/enhancement is to be able to guess the SRS of a shapefile,
from its associated .prj file, when PROJECTION AUTO is specified in its LAYER
definition.

3.6 Restrictions
................

This RFC only implements TILESRS support for raster layers. Support in vector
layers is out of scope.

3.7 Documentation
.................

The following pages will be updated to document the TILESRS keyword :
  * :ref:`tileindex`
  * :ref:`layer`
  * :ref:`raster`

5 GDAL related enhancements
---------------------------

5.1 gdaltindex
..............

The gdaltindex utility will be upgraded to add a -src_srs_name option that
match with the value of the TILESRS keyword. It will also support created
tileindex in all supported OGR formats with the -f option (up to now only
shapefile were supported).

Example for a shapefile tileindex :
::

    gdaltindex -t_srs EPSG:26711 -src_srs_name src_srs tile_index_mixed_srs_26711.shp *.tif


Example for a PostGIS layer tileindex :

::

    gdaltindex -f "PostgreSQL" -t_srs EPSG:26711 -src_srs_name src_srs -lyr_name index_26711 pg:dbname=autotest *.tif

5.2 wcs_virtds_params.py
........................

A sample script, wcs_virtds_params.py, will be added to generate the WCS
layer definition from a tileindex with mixed SRS.

Example for a shapefile tileindex :

::

    $ python swig/python/samples/wcs_virtds_params.py tile_index_mixed_srs_26711.shp -src_srs_name src_srs

.. code-block:: mapfile

    LAYER
        NAME "tile_index_mixed_srs_26711"
        TYPE RASTER
        STATUS ON
        DUMP TRUE
        TILEINDEX "tile_index_mixed_srs_26711.shp"
        TILEITEM "location"
        TILESRS "src_srs"
        PROJECTION
            "+init=epsg:26711" 
        END
        METADATA   
            "wcs_label"       "tile_index_mixed_srs_26711"
            "wcs_rangeset_name"   "Range 1"  ### required to support DescribeCoverage request
            "wcs_rangeset_label"  "My Label" ### required to support DescribeCoverage request
            "wcs_extent"      "440701.103108 3745270.030930 446726.551080 3751320.000893"
            "wcs_size"        "100 101"
            "wcs_resolution"  "60.019424 60.019424"
        END
    END


Example for a PostGIS layer tileindex :

::

    $ python swig/python/samples/wcs_virtds_params.py pg:dbname=autotest -lyr_name index_26711 -src_srs_name src_srs

.. code-block:: mapfile

    LAYER
        NAME "index_26711_tileindex"
        TYPE POLYGON
        STATUS OFF
        DUMP FALSE
        CONNECTIONTYPE OGR
        CONNECTION "pg:dbname=autotest,index_26711"
        PROJECTION
            "+init=epsg:26711" 
        END
    END

    LAYER

            "wcs_resolution"  "60.019424 60.019424"
        END
    END
